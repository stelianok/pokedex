## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª About the project

Based on the [figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/93B3kixUybydmxNFU3ByQ2/Pok%C3%A9dex-(Community)-(Copy)?node-id=314-3&t=g4in5Iw1ypMcQbKZ-0) created by Ricardo Schiniegoski

This project was developed following the figma design mentioned above, but since this design It's for a mobile version, I decided to code the project with a "mobile first" approach, and then just adapt the interface for desktop later. 

I ended up running out of time to fully implement a completely responsive and adaptive interface, so the interface looks really nice on mobile, but It's a little janky on desktop.
